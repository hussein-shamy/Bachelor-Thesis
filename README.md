# Bachelor's Thesis
A collaborative repository for my Bachelor's thesis focused on optimizing the Cell Outage Compensation (COC) algorithm in Self-Organizing Networks (SONs). The project aims to bolster 5G network reliability, leveraging hardware acceleration, particularly for emerging technologies like autonomous driving.
