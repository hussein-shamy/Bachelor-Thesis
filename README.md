# Meeting 5G Reliability Demands with Hardware Acceleration in Cell Outage Compensation for Self-Organizing Network
A Thesis submitted to the Faculty of Engineering at Tanta University in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of BACHELOR OF SCIENCE in Electronics and Communications Engineering

This is a collaborative repository for our Bachelor's thesis focused on optimizing the Cell Outage Compensation (COC) algorithm in Self-Organizing Networks (SONs). The project aims to bolster 5G network reliability, leveraging hardware acceleration, particularly for emerging technologies like autonomous driving.
